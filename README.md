## End-users of the Project:

Users can easily navigate through previously visited pages by clicking the back and forward buttons, providing a familiar and essential browsing experience.

### 3. User-Defined Customizable Home Button
Users can set a custom homepage that can be accessed by clicking on a customizable home button.
This feature allows users to define a specific website or a local file as their homepage. Clicking on the home button will then take them to this designated page.

WebBro's password manager allows users to save and retrieve passwords for different websites, streamlining the login process while maintaining security.

### 7. Customizable Search Engines
